                        class="text-muted">Here's where to get your dose of FLW on the Eastern seaboard</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">This June 8 marks the 150th anniversary of celebrated American architect Frank Lloyd
                    Wright's birth in 1867. His work revolutionized the American approach to living and function, as he
                    steadily embraced change and experimented with new materials. Wright transformed the way in which we
                    live through his innovative, sustainable design, and left his mark on hundreds of buildings around
                    the country—532, to be exact—with hundreds more designed but never realized. Over the course of his
                    seven-decade career, the architect was committed to democratic design, saying, "Above all,
                    integrity, buildings, like people, must first be sincere, must be true." His philosophy is evident
                    throughout his work: Wright designed environments that are both functional and elegant.

                        mind.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">Welcome to CNET's guide to the Google Home smart speaker and Google's growing lineup of
                    smart home gadgets. Perhaps you're wondering if you need a smart speaker like the Google Nest Mini,
                    a smart display like the Nest Hub, both or neither. Do you want one with Google Assistant or with
                    Amazon's competitive voice assistant, Alexa? Should you buy one now or wait until Google's next
                    mysterious speaker launches?

                    Maybe you've already made your decision and bought one of Google's smart speakers or smart displays
                    and now you want to know what you should do with it.

                    I can help. Below, I'll familiarize you with the basics of Google Home, then dive into everything
                    you can do once you're up and running. I'll also look at the flaws of the system and what's next for
                    the Google Nest smart home.

                    If you're not sure whether you want a Google Home, an Amazon Echo or perhaps an Apple HomePod, I can
                    help with that, too. CNET has created a guide to buying the right smart speaker for you, and here's
                    a breakdown of the three main digital assistants built in to smart speakers -- Google Assistant,
                    Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri.</p>

                <p class="lead">While the iPhone 13 is months away from its release, we've already started seeing plenty
                    of rumors about what Apple has in store for us when the phone arrives in the fall.

                    From everything we've heard so far, the iPhone 13 is set to offer a 120Hz LTPO display on both Pro
                    models, improved battery life thanks to a more efficient 5G modem, as well as substantial upgrades
                    to the all-important cameras. That includes a LiDAR sensor on cheaper iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini,
                    as well as a new portrait video mode.

                    The best iPhones you can buy today
                    Here are the best camera phones right now
                    As for the design, we've heard that the notch is shrinking. Some other rumors have suggested that at
                    least one iPhone 13 model may come with a truly portless design, but that's now contested. That's
                    actually possible now that we have MagSafe charging. We could finally see an always-on display, too.

                    Based on all the rumors and leaks out there already, here's everything we know about the iPhone 13.
